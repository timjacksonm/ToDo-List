## Goals:
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Create the code that generates your ToDos using factories or constructors/classes.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Implement all the properties your ToDos are going to have. e.g. title, description, due date, priority, notes, check list.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] ToDo list should have projects or separate list of todos. Create option where the user can create a new Project and choose to assign ToDo's to it or another project.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Separate your application logic into separate modules/js files.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] User interface should be able to 1.) view all projects 2.) view all todos in each project 3.) expand a single todo to see/edit details 4.) delete todo.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Use local storage to save user's projects and todos between sessions.

**Optional Extra Credit**
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Implement a light and dark mode.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Add library code date-fns to project.

**View Commits on project to see changes**

## Summary

I found this project very rewarding. From using webpack librarys like date-fns, separating my apps logic into different es6 modules and also manipulating my array data inside of local storage. I learned a lot!  Most challenging for me was figuring out all the different ways you could 'break' this app and implementing fixes. You can add / modify / delete any task or projects. Everything is saved in memory so if you leave the page and come back what you changed/added should still be present. I did get around to adding a light/dark mode to one of my projects finally, it works well - I had used css variables to change the theme. I created multiple default task to showcase the different things you can do with my ToDo-List. Feel free to try it out! If you need to revert the ToDo-List back to the default setup. Go into console and type localStorage.clear().
